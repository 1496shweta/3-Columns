CSS Grid and Columns
Introduction
CSS Grid is a layout system designed to create two-dimensional web layouts, offering precise control over rows and columns. It simplifies designing responsive and complex layouts by using grid properties.

1. Grid Basics
Definition: CSS Grid is a container-based layout model for structuring web content in rows and columns.
Grid Container: To create a grid layout, the parent container must have display: grid or display: inline-grid.
Grid Items: The direct child elements of the grid container are automatically arranged based on grid definitions.
2. Defining Columns
Columns in CSS Grid are defined using the grid-template-columns property, which specifies the number, size, and proportion of columns.

Common Column Definitions:
Fixed Width: Columns with a specific width (e.g., 200px).
Fractional Units (fr): Divide the available space proportionally (e.g., 1fr 2fr).
Auto Fit/Fill: Automatically adjust the number of columns based on the container size (repeat(auto-fit, minmax(100px, 1fr))).
3. Responsive Design with Media Queries
Media queries enable dynamic grid layouts based on the screen size.
Use @media rules to redefine grid-template-columns for different breakpoints.
Example: Change from a single column on mobile to multiple columns on larger screens.
4. Best Practices
Plan the Layout: Sketch a rough layout before implementing the grid structure.
Use Fractional Units: Prefer fr units for flexible layouts over percentages or fixed units.
Minimize Overlap: Use explicit row/column definitions to avoid unintended overlaps.
Keep It Responsive: Combine CSS Grid with media queries for adaptive designs.
